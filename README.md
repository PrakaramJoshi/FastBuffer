# FastBuffer
Very Fast MPMC C++ implementation
A very small and very fast implementation of the thread safe blocking queue. I have benchmarked it with respect to fastflow mpmc queues, boost::lockfree queue, concurrentqueue at https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue. The benchmarks puts this implementation way ahead of all. I will upload the benchmark data, setup soon.
